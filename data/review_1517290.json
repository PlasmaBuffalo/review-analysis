The game's gunplay feels tighter, and the overall experience is more polished compared to the initial release.\n\nHowever, the one aspect that still requires attention is the player count. Battlefield 2042 thrives on large-scale battles, but finding a full lobby can be hit or miss, especially in certain regions. It's a bit disheartening to see such expansive maps with not enough soldiers to fill them, affecting the overall balance and enjoyment of the game.\n\nAnother head-scratcher is the map rotation decision. Some maps seem to appear more frequently than others, leading to a somewhat repetitive experience or the maps get removed from DICE. Weirdly often the most fun ones. \n\nIn conclusion, Battlefield 2042 has certainly taken a step in the right direction, and the improvements are commendable. \nHere's hoping for continued updates and refinements to make this futuristic battlefield the best it can be! \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1700668628, "timestamp_updated": 1700668628, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.560856878757476807", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "152511742": {"recommendationid": "152511742", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010025293", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 292, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 292, "last_played": 1701261478}, "language": "english", "review": "What a Fantastic way to make me download Battlefield 4 Again!", "timestamp_created": 1701261592, "timestamp_updated": 1701261592, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.560439586639404297", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150454588": {"recommendationid": "150454588", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065585311", "num_games_owned": 250, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1996, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1954, "last_played": 1700429470}, "language": "english", "review": "I have played every battlefield game since bf bad company 2 but this game is clearly the worst of them all.

This is my first battlefield game that I've played since Bad Company 2 and Battlefield 3, and this game doesn't live up to them. The game play is fun and the shooting is satisfying, but that's about it. The maps are boring. They're too open, spaced out, and there's no real flow to them. The destructible environments might as well not exist. The classes are also boring. \n\nThe game play feels watered down because it doesn't feel dynamic and it just comes down to shooting. Each class has a certain special ability like all the other battlefield games, but since the game play is so fast paced and the maps are so open, they don't feel unique or have any real utility. Medics can be useful sometimes, but if you have decent squad mates, then they can revive you anyway regardless of their class. Also since any class can use any type of weapon, it makes the class type even more moot. Sure each class specializes in a certain weapon type and they gain certain benefits from it, but it's really not that big of a hindrance to use a different weapon.\n\nI can't really explain it, but between the poor map design, the game's fast paced focus (faster than what a good Battlefield game feels like), and the fading of classes, it just feels like a watered down shooter that looks like a Battlefield game, but lost touch with what a Battlefield game is suppose to be. All I want is more Bad Company.\n\nActually, all I want is a 2142 remake.\n\nAlso, fuck you EA for locking a third of your content behind the elite edition.\n\nIs it worth $10.00? For some mindless fun, sure. It beats getting an aneurysm from sweating in Warzone. Is it ever worth handing over your money to EA?
