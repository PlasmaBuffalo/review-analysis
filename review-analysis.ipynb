    "# Review Analysis and Classification for Battlefield 2042\n",
    "\n",
    "By Liam Zalubas\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction: \n",
    "\n",
    "The Battlefield franchise of video games is generally known for combining multiplayer infantry and vehicle combat in dynamic and destructible environments. Battlefield 2042 is the latest entry in the series, having been released in October of 2021. The game is available on console and PC hardware, and is available on the Steam, Origin, and the Epic Games digital marketplaces. From this point forward, I will be referring to the Steam version of the game, as it is the version I was able to collect data on most readily. Because of this, any conclusions drawn from this project may not be applicable to the game as a whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of player reception, Battlefield 2042 initially released to overwhelmingly negative reviews, but has been updated consistently since release. Over two years after its release, the game has seen a significant increase in positive reviews, bringing its overall review score from \"Mostly Negative\" (~31% positive) to \"Mostly Positive\" (~71% positive).\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to analyze the reviews of Battlefield 2042 on Steam by writing a program for a classifier which we will train to predict the most common words in a review based on whether the review is positive or negative and the date the review was most recently updated."

    "## Data Gathering: \n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in this project was to gather the data. To download reviews on Steam, we can use the Steam API. The Steam API is a web API which allows us to access data from the Steam store and community pages. For Python, we can import the `steamreviews` library to access the API. The following code makes a request to the API for some reviews of Battlefield 2042, and saves the results to a pandas dataframe."

    "When collecting data, it is important to consider the ethics of the data collection and how mistakes or oversights in the data collection process can skew our results. In this particular example, we are considering reviews in English on the Steam store. Because this game is available on other digital distribution platforms for the PC, on gaming consoles (XBox, PlayStation), and in other countries, we must recognize that this data set is a subset of a larger data set. This means that any conclusions we draw from this data set may not be applicable to the entirety of public opinion on the game as a whole. "
